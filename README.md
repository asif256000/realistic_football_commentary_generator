# Realistic Football Commentary Generator

This is our attempt at generating realistic football commentary from video captures of FIFA Gameplay. 

We are working on this project as part of our Spring 2024 Creative AI Capstone (CS46644/ CS5934) project at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg.

You can watch the demo of the finished product here:

Some future works that can be added to the project are:

- [ ] Use SORA or some other model to generate high quality videos to go with the summary, rather than displaying static pictures,
- [ ] Generate the audio files quicker, so that the experience of generating summary for the games are seamless,
- [ ] Generate higher quality images which are event specific for every paragraph.
